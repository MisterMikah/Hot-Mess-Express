Hot Mess Express is a chaotic 3D cooking and delivery game made in Unity.  
Cook the meal, dodge traffic, and try to deliver your food before time runs out or before it’s completely destroyed.


# Game Summary
Players start by cooking food through quick, simple minigames, then jump straight into a high speed delivery run through a city filled with obstacles.  
Every collision damages the food, reducing your score and risking total failure.  
Deliver the meal fast, and in one piece, to earn the customer’s satisfaction.  
Mess up too badly... and they’ll chase you down.
